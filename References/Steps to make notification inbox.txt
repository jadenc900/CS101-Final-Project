1.	Database design: store information about each user and their notifications in a database. 
-	for a database in a FLASK application is SQLite or a more robust relational database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. 
-	create a table to store the user information, and another table to store the notifications. 
-	establish a relationship between the user and their notifications, such as a foreign key relationship.
2.	User authentication: To access the inbox, a user will need to log in to your FLASK application. implement user authentication using a library such as Flask-Login.

3.	Adding notifications: When an event occurs : notify the user about
-	add a new record to the notifications table in the database. 
-	use FLASK's database library, such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, to interact with the database and insert new records.
4.	Displaying notifications: When a user logs in, retrieve the notifications for that user from the database and display them in the inbox
- use a template engine such as Jinja2 to render the notifications in HTML.
5.	Marking notifications as read: When a user has read a notification, need to update the corresponding record in the database to indicate that it has been read. 
-	provide a button in the inbox that the user can click to mark a notification as read.
6.	Removing notifications: remove notifications that are no longer relevant, such as notifications that are more than a certain number of days old.
-	 using a task scheduler such as Celery or a cron job to periodically remove outdated notifications from the database.



Implement a notification inbox in your FLASK application:
1.	Set up FLASK environment and install the necessary dependencies. 
-  FLASK framework, a database library such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, and a template engine such as Jinja2.
2.	Design database schema to store user information and notifications. 
-	create tables for users and notifications and establish a relationship between them.
3.	Implement user authentication using a library such as Flask-Login. This will allow users to log in to your application and access their notifications.

4.	Write code to add new notifications to the database when events occur that you want to notify the user about. You could use the database library, such as Flask-SQLAlchemy, to insert new records into the notifications table.

5.	Write code to retrieve the notifications for a user from the database and display them in the inbox. 
-	template engine such as Jinja2 to render the notifications in HTML.

6.	Write code to mark notifications as read when the user has read them. You could provide a button in the inbox that the user can click to mark a notification as read, and then update the corresponding record in the database.
-	How? 
7.	Write code to periodically remove outdated notifications from the database 
-	a task scheduler such as Celery or a cron job to run a script that removes notifications that are older than a certain number of days.
-	
8.	Test your implementation by adding notifications, logging in as a user, and checking the inbox to make sure that the notifications are displayed correctly.
